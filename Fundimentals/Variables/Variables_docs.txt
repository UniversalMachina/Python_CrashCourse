Introduction to Variables

- Definition: Variables are labels or placeholders that can store data values.
- Dynamic Typing: In Python, you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly. It is inferred from the assigned value.

Creating and Assigning Variables

- Assignment Operator: `=`

Assigning values to variables
x = 5
name = "Alice"
pi = 3.14159
is_active = True

Multiple assignments
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3

Python is case-sensitive, so Name and name are different variables.

Variable Types

Python has several built-in data types:

- Numbers: int, float, complex
- Strings: str
- Boolean: bool
- Lists: Ordered collection of items, list
- Tuples: Ordered and immutable collection, tuple
- Dictionaries: Key-value pairs, dict
- Sets: Unordered collection of unique elements, set

Examples

Integer (int)
x = 10

Floating-point number (float)
y = 10.5

String (str)
name = "OpenAI"

Boolean (bool)
is_coding_fun = True

List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

Tuple
coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)

Dictionary
person = {"name": "John", "age": 30}

Set
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Printing Variables

To print a variable, use the print() function:

x = 42
message = "The answer to life, the universe, and everything is"
print(message, x)

Variable Re-assignment

Variables can be re-assigned to new values of any data type:

variable = 10       # Initially an integer
variable = "hello"  # Now it's a string
variable = [1, 2]   # Finally, a list

Tips on Naming Variables

- Descriptive: Use meaningful names like total, count, etc.
- No Spaces: Use underscores for multi-word names (total_count).
- Avoid Keywords: Python has reserved words like if, else, True, etc. You cannot use them as variable names.

Conclusion

Variables are fundamental to programming and Python makes working with them straightforward. As you continue coding, you'll encounter many ways to manipulate and use variables for more complex tasks.
